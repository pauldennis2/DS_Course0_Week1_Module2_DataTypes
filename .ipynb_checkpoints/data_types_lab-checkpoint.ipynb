    "You are an analyst for GolStats Soccer Technologies, a soccer (football) analytics agency. They are interested in an analysis of various recent FIFA world cups -- specifically looking at the performance of a country in World cups in relation to their population. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked with looking specifically at the sample of World Cup games in 2018 and seeing whether this has any relationship with the corresponding 2018 populations of the participating nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal will be to create a data structure containing the requisite information for your analysis. Specifically, you'll build a dictionary where each key is the name of a country, and each value is a nested dictionary containing information about the number of 2018 World Cup wins and the country's population in 2018.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What is the relationship between the population of a country and their performance in the 2018 FIFA World Cup?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what is our **unit of analysis**, and what is the **unique identifier**? In other words, what will one record in our final data structure represent, and what attribute uniquely describes it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Our unit of analysis is a* ***country*** *and the unique identifier we'll use is the* ***country name***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what **features** are we analyzing? In other words, what attributes of each country are we interested in?\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Our features are* ***2018 population*** *and* ***count of wins in the 2018 World Cup***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset to Start With\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, which dataset should we **start** with? In this case, any record with missing data is not useful to us, so we want to start with the smaller dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are only 32 countries that compete in the World Cup each year, compared to hundreds of countries in the world, so we should start with the* ***2018 World Cup*** *dataset. Then we can join it with the relevant records from the country population dataset.*"
